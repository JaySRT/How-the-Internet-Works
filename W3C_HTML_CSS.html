            <div class="container">
                <h1 class="mt-5">What is W3C, HTML and CSS?</h1>
                <p class="lead">W3C Stands for "World Wide Web Consortium." The W3C is an international community that
                    includes a full-time staff, industry experts, and several member organizations. These groups work
                    together to develop standards for the World Wide Web.</p>
                <p class="lead">The mission of the W3C is to lead the Web to its full potential by developing relevant
                    protocols and guidelines. This is achieved primarily by creating and publishing Web standards. By
                    adopting the Web standards created by the W3C, hardware manufacturers and software developers can
                    ensure their equipment and programs work with the latest Web technologies. For example, most Web
                    browsers incorporate several W3C standards, which allows them to interpret the latest versions of
                    HTML and CSS code. When browsers conform to the W3C standards, it also helps Web pages appear
                    consistent across different browsers.</p>
                <p class="lead">Besides HTML and CSS standards, the W3C also provides standards for Web graphics, as
                    well as audio and video on the Web. The organization also develops standards for Web applications,
                    Web scripting, and dynamic content. Additionally, the W3C provides privacy and
                    security guidelines that websites should follow.</p>
                <p class="lead">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed
                    to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
                    (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
                <p class="lead">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and
                    other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a
                    means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
                    paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. </p>
                <p class="lead">HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
                    using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img/&gt; and &lt;input/&gt; directly introduce content into
                    the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may
                    include other tags as sub-elements.
                    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
                <p class="lead">CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". It is a simple design language intended
                    to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.</p>
                <p class="lead">CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color
                    of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out,
                    what background images or colors are used, layout designs, variations in display for different
                    devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.</p>
                <p class="lead">CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the
                    presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or
                    XHTML.</p>
                <p class="lead">CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS
                    Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a specification
                    has been discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a recommendation.</p>
