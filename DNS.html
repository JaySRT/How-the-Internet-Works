                <p class="lead">DNS stands for “Domain Name System”. It’s a system that lets you connect to websites by
                    matching human-readable domain names (like google.com) with the unique ID of the server where a
                    website is stored.</p>
                <p class="lead">Think of the DNS system as the internet’s phonebook. It lists domain names with their
                    corresponding identifiers called IP addresses, instead of listing people’s names with their phone
                    numbers. When a user enters a domain name like google.com on their device, it looks up the IP
                    address and connects them to the physical location where that website is stored.</p>
                <p><img src="images/Age-of-eCommerce-2020-scaled-e1604504823964.jpeg" alt="Age of E-commerce"
                        width="750" height="357"></p>
                <p class="lead">Much of its work has concerned the Internet's global Domain Name System (DNS), including
                    policy development for internationalization of the DNS system, introduction of new generic top-level
                    domains (TLDs), and the operation of root name servers. The numbering facilities ICANN manages
                    include the Internet Protocol address spaces for IPv4 and IPv6, and assignment of address blocks to
                    regional Internet registries. ICANN also maintains registries of Internet Protocol identifiers.</p>
                <p class="lead"></p>
                <p class="lead">Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. However,
                    because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version
                    of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998. IPv6 deployment has been
                    ongoing since the mid-2000s. </p>
                <p class="lead">IP addresses are written and displayed in human-readable notations, such as 172.16.254.1
                    in IPv4, and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6. The size of the routing prefix of the address is
                    designated in CIDR notation by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g.,
                    192.168.1.15/24, which is equivalent to the historically used subnet mask 255.255.255.0.</p>
                <p class="lead">An IP address serves two principal functions. It identifies the host, or more
                    specifically its network interface, and it provides the location of the host in the network, and
                    thus the capability of establishing a path to that host. Its role has been characterized as follows:
                    "A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get
                    there." The header of each IP packet contains the IP address of the sending host, and that of the
                    destination host.</p>
