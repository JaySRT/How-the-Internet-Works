                <p class="lead">DNS stands for “Domain Name System”. It’s a system that lets you connect to websites by
                    matching human-readable domain names (like google.com) with the unique ID of the server where a
                    website is stored.</p>
                <p class="lead">Think of the DNS system as the internet’s phonebook. It lists domain names with their
                    corresponding identifiers called IP addresses, instead of listing people’s names with their phone
                    numbers. When a user enters a domain name like google.com on their device, it looks up the IP
                    address and connects them to the physical location where that website is stored.</p>
                <p><img src="Images/What-Is-DNS.jpg" alt="What is DNS"
                        width="550" height="357"></p>
                <p class="lead">The internet is a giant network of computers. Each device connected to the internet is
                    assigned a unique IP address which helps other computers identify it. This IP address is a string of
                    numbers with periods that looks like this: 192.114.249.146</p>
                <p class="lead">Now imagine if you had to remember such long strings of numbers to visit your favorite
                    websites. They are hard to remember and don’t tell you anything about the website you’ll see if you
                    enter them in a browser.</p>
                <p class="lead">Domain names were invented to solve this problem by using alphabets and allowing users
                    to select easy to remember names for their websites. DNS or Domain Name System basically translates
                    those domain names into IP addresses and points your
                    device in the right direction. A domain name and its matching IP address is called a “DNS
                    record”.</p>

                <p class="lead">Here is a simple way to understand how DNS works in four steps. Suppose you want to
                    visit our site at www.wpbeginner.com. </p>
                <p class="lead">IP addresses are written and displayed in human-readable notations, such as 172.16.254.1
                    in IPv4, and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6. The size of the routing prefix of the address is
                    designated in CIDR notation by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g.,
                    192.168.1.15/24, which is equivalent to the historically used subnet mask 255.255.255.0.</p>
                <p class="lead">An IP address serves two principal functions. It identifies the host, or more
                    specifically its network interface, and it provides the location of the host in the network, and
                    thus the capability of establishing a path to that host. Its role has been characterized as follows:
                    "A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get
                    there." The header of each IP packet contains the IP address of the sending host, and that of the
                    destination host.</p>
